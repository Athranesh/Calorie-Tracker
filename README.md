# Calorie-Tracker
A calorie tracker app made without any JS libraries or frameworks. Uses pure JavaScript, including ES6+.

The app has state management and CRUD functionality and stores data in local storage, persisting until deleted by user.

As the app is made using only vanilla JS, I decided against using any calorie fetching APIs, as it would be better done using React.

Version 1.0.0
